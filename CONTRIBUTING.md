### PR Best Practices

To ensure your contribution is integrated smoothly, please:

- ✅ Ensure your PR is **up-to-date** with the `ultralytics/yolov3` `master` branch. If your PR is behind, update your code by clicking the 'Update branch' button or by running `git pull` and `git merge master` locally.

- ✅ Confirm that all Continuous Integration (CI) **checks are passing**.

- ✅ Limit your changes to the **minimum required** for your bug fix or feature.
